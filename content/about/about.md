I am a physiologist with over 20 years of experience in research design, analysis, and training in the biomedical sciences.

I also have more than a decade of experience in the pharmaceutical industry doing consultancy work, training, and conducting market research, so I am adept at planning and executing research and training programmes in a commercial environment.

For more information on the services I offer, continue to browse the information on this website or contact me to arrange a free consultation.
